# Documentation Hub

This folder is the source of truth for product direction, migration scope, and execution tracking.

## Document Map

- <TO GENERATE>

## Working Rules

- Docs are mandatory for migration decisions and changes.
- Tasks are tracked in the hybrid system (board + per-task file).
- Selection and dependency specs must be updated before behavior changes.

## Change Control

- Update PRD first for scope changes.
- Add or update task files before implementation starts.
- Keep this index current when adding new docs.
