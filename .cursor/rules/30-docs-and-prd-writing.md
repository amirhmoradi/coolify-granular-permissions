# Docs and PRD Standards

- Keep docs actionable and decision-oriented.
- Include explicit scope, non-goals, and acceptance criteria.
- Link related files using repository-relative paths.

# Task System Standards

- Task file in `docs/tasks/items/` is source of truth.
- Keep `docs/tasks/board.md` synchronized with task status.
- Every task must include dependencies and validation steps.
